it is starting out as a small bank app but it might evolve later idk yet tbh.


## General Layout according to my old version:

1. Main file.
2. Account Management File.
3. Show Details File.
4. Utility File.
5. Validation File.

### Specific features:
**1. Main file:**

    - Asks the questions to guide the User to the correct section of the app through the terminal.
    - Takes all the information needed from the user and forwards it to the correct functions and or text files from the terminal.
    - Is the merge between all the files to have them work together in harmony.

**2. Account Management File:**

    - Make an account.
    - Modify an account.
    - Delete an account.

**3. Show Details File:**

    - Shows the details of any account that is set up.

**4. Utility File:**

    - Saves the information to a text file.
    - Takes information from a text file to a function.

**5. Verification File:**

    - Verifies the information with the text file information.
